                <p className="">
                We set out in 2008 to balance ethics and technology to reimagine how the ideal trading experience could be. Today, as a leader in the industry of CFD trading, servicing over 800,000 active traders, we know weâ€™re on the right path.
                </p>

                <p>
                We built our proprietary trading features so we could offer something unique, something no other broker had ever attempted. We were the first to offer traders instant withdrawals*, stop out protection and more. Features that give traders an edge.
                </p>

                <p>
                Trading is just one part of the picture. We believe in creating ecosystems of benefit for traders, partners, and employees to thrive within. Making what once was deemed impossible, a reality.
